# Barcode-Detection
This repository contains codes to detect and decode barcodes in images and videos using the pyzbar library in Python. The code draws a bounding box aroung the detected barcodes and annotates its type and decoded value.
<br>The code for videos also has a line commented to save a video to a set of frames. Uncomment that line to do the same. I have also added a code that assembles these frames with bounding boxes and annotations into a video, for those looking to save the results to a video.
